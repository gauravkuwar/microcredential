      One of the most famous fountains in the world, the Trevi Fountain in Rome is an unmissable sight when visiting the romantic city. Sandwiched between a number of small streets in the heart of Rome, the Baroque-style fountain depicts Oceanus, God of water surrounded by the statues of Abundance, Salubrity, tritons and hippocamps. Built using local Travertine stone in 1762, Trevi Fountain stands 26 feet tall and 49 feet wide, so has naturally required some renovation over the years, most recently in 2015. After the Fendi-sponsored restoration three years ago, now is the best time to visit Trevi Fountain in Italy and admire the iconic masterpiece in all its glory.

      Prior to the construction of the Trevi Fountain, another fountain dating back to Roman times existed in its place. In 1629 Pope Urban VIII concluded the fountain was insufficient so he commissioned Italian architect, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, to sketch some renovation ideas. However, following the Pope’s death in 1744, the plans were never bought to life, though some of Bernini’s touches can be seen on the fountain today.
